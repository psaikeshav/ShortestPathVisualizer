# ShortestPathVisualizer
Shortest Path Visualizer â€“ Greedy Approach" is an interactive tool for visualizing the greedy approach to finding the shortest path in graphs. Utilizing popular graph theory algorithms like Dijkstra's, this project provides a hands-on demonstration of how greedy strategies navigate through nodes to reach the target efficiently. The repository includes clear documentation, code implementations, and a user-friendly interface for experimenting with different graph configurations and observing the algorithm's behavior in real-time. Dive into the world of graph traversal and optimization with this educational and informative repository.
